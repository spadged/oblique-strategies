Oblique-Strategies
==================

<p>A tiny HTML5 / JS / CSS app, based on the obscure but quite popular <strong>oblique strategies</strong> by 
<a href="http://www.enoshop.co.uk/">Brian Eno</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.peterschmidtweb.com/">Peter Schmidt</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These cards evolved from our separate observations on the principles underlying what we were doing. 
Sometimes they were recognized in retrospect (intellect catching up with intuition), sometimes they 
were identified as they were happening, sometimes they were formulated.</p>
				
<p>They can be used as a pack (a set of possibilities being continuously reviewed in the mind) 
or by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation. 
In this case,the card is trusted even if its appropriateness is quite unclear. They are not final, 
as new ideas will present themselves, and others will become self-evident.</p>
